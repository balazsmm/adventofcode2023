# AdventOfCode2023



Python solutions for the 2023. Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an excercise for programmers of all languages around the world organized in the Advent period each year. Participants receive a two phase task and a unique dataset to use with the program they code to generate a result that is checked by the server for correctness. A point is awarded for each good answer per phase. Participants might race for being among the quickest in the global or local leaderboards or use the opportunity to learn, broaden horizons or just to have fun.
